    <h2> About Me. </h2> 

<p>My name is Jade Featherstone and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.
Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch. 
I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.</p>
